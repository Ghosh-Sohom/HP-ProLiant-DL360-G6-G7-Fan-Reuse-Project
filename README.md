# HP-ProLiant-GL360-G6-G7-Fan-Reuse-Project
This repo contains everything you need to reuse HP ProLiant GL360 G6 and G7 server fans which are un-reusable due to its proprietary connectors. With the help of this repository, you can now reuse these fans for your own projects. Included are pinout diagrams, PCB designs, and Arduino code that will allow you to control the fan speed using PWM.

# HP Proliant DL360 G6/G7 Server Fan Assembly Module Reuse Project

This GitHub repository provides information, diagrams, PCB designs, and Arduino code to help users reuse the HP Proliant Series DL360 G6 and G7 fans. These fans come with proprietary connectors, which make them unusable outside their intended use. With the information and tools provided in this repository, users can now utilize these fans for other purposes, including computer cooling systems, personal projects, or other industrial applications.
